	<h1>Don't be afraid to be &lt; then a 100% success &amp; &gt; more:
	</h1>
		<p>&quot;It is not the critic who counts: no the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,or where the door of deeds could have done then better, 
		the in the arena, 
		whose face is marred by dyst and swear and blood who strives valiently; 
		who errs who comes short again and again, because there is no effort whithout errors and shortcoming; 
		but who dirs actually strives to do the deed who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotion; 
		who spend himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and 
		who at the worst, if he falls, at least falls while daring greatly, 
		so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;
