			<p> students & Writers mostly look for some questions when coming to paragraph writing about any topic or thing or person. The questions raised by most of the students while thinking about writing a paragraph are Paragraph Writing Examples, What is the perfect paragraph format? How many steps involved to write a paragraph? How to write a good paragraph? How many sentences are included in a para? and many more like these.

			<p>This example shows how one student approached the writing prompt “What is your favorite day of the week and why?” The original draft has some interesting ideas but overall, the paragraph wanders. It includes both relevant and irrelevant details and lacks the coherent focus required for a successful paragraph.In Time4Writing courses, students are taught that the revision process is vital to writing successful paragraphs. They learn how to use this key step to eliminate unnecessary details and write a tightly structured paragraph.

			<h3>(#section3) section 3</h3>
			<p>Sunday is my favorite day of the week. I like it because on Sunday, I watch football. On other days, I also get to watch football but not all day. There are other sports on other days to watch on TV. Sunday lunch is a favorite of mine because I eat with my father in front of the TV. All the other days, I have to eat at the table which is less fun. Some days my dad doesn’t make it home from work until after I’m in bed. Some weeks my dad travels, and I don’t see him for several days. The highlight of the day is when we watch the Dolphins play. Dad and I get so excited, we yell and cheer together. The thing that I like to do best in the world is watch TV with my dad.

			<p> Coherence. Coherence is the quality that makes your writing understandable. Sentences within a paragraph need to connect to each other and work together as a whole. One of the best ways to achieve coherency is to use transition words. These words create bridges from one sentence to the next. You can use transition words that show order (first, second, third); spatial relationships (above, below) or logic (furthermore, in addition, in fact). Also, in writing a paragraph, using a consistent verb tense and point of view are important ingredients for coherency.

			<h3>(#section5) section 5</h3>
			<p>Unity. Unity in a paragraph begins with the topic sentence. Every paragraph has one single, controlling idea that is expressed in its topic sentence, which is typically the first sentence of the paragraph. A paragraph is unified around this main idea, with the supporting sentences providing detail and discussion. In order to write a good topic sentence, think about your theme and all the points you want to make. Decide which point drives the rest, and then write it as your topic sentence.
